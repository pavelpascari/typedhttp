# TypedHTTP Project Status

## 🚧 Current Status: Experimental

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-03

### Project Phase: Early Development

TypedHTTP is currently in **experimental/proof-of-concept** phase. This means:

- ⚠️ **Not production-ready**: This framework should not be used in production environments
- 🧪 **Active experimentation**: APIs and features may change significantly
- 🔍 **Seeking feedback**: We're exploring type-safe HTTP patterns for Go

## 📊 Development Metrics

### Test Coverage
- Current: Aiming for >80% coverage
- Target: Maintain >80% for production readiness

### Performance
- ⚠️ **Performance claims unverified**: We have not submitted to independent benchmarks like TechEmpower
- 🔬 **Internal testing only**: Current benchmarks are internal and not independently validated
- 🎯 **Goal**: Submit to TechEmpower benchmarks for independent validation

### Community
- 👤 **Single maintainer**: Currently maintained by one developer
- 🌱 **Early stage**: No production usage examples yet
- 🤝 **Seeking contributors**: Looking for community members to help validate and improve the framework

## 🎯 Roadmap to Stability

### Phase 1: Technical Validation (Current - Next 3 months)
- [ ] Create independent benchmark suite
- [ ] Submit to TechEmpower benchmarks
- [ ] Build 3-5 real-world example applications
- [ ] Establish reproducible testing methodology

### Phase 2: Community Building (3-6 months)
- [ ] Establish governance structure
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines
- [ ] Build community presence (r/golang, conferences)
- [ ] Gather feedback from early adopters

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (6-12 months)
- [ ] Achieve independent performance validation
- [ ] Document real production usage examples
- [ ] Establish enterprise support options
- [ ] Security audit and vulnerability management

## 🔬 What We're Exploring

### Core Hypothesis
Can Go generics provide meaningful type safety benefits for HTTP APIs without significant performance costs?

### Key Questions
1. **Performance Impact**: What is the actual performance overhead of type-safe request handling?
2. **Developer Experience**: Does type safety reduce development time and runtime errors?
3. **Community Fit**: Do Go developers value type safety enough to adopt a new framework?
4. **Migration Path**: How easy is it to migrate from existing frameworks like Gin, Echo, or Chi?

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### Performance
- Performance characteristics under real workloads are unknown
- No independent benchmarking or validation
- Memory allocation patterns not optimized

### Ecosystem
- Limited middleware ecosystem
- No integration with popular Go tools yet
- Unknown compatibility with production stacks

### Documentation
- Examples are primarily synthetic
- No migration guides from production applications
- Limited troubleshooting documentation

## 🤝 How to Help

### For Developers
- Try TypedHTTP in non-production projects
- Report bugs and share feedback
- Contribute examples and documentation
- Help with testing and validation

### For the Community
- Share experience with type-safe HTTP patterns
- Provide feedback on API design
- Contribute to architectural discussions
- Help establish best practices

## 📈 Success Metrics

We will consider TypedHTTP successful when:

1. **Independent Validation**: Performance claims verified by TechEmpower benchmarks
2. **Production Usage**: At least 5 documented production applications
3. **Community Growth**: Active contributors and community engagement
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: Compatibility with major Go tools and frameworks

## 🔍 Transparency Commitment

This project believes in honest, transparent communication:

- We will not make unverified performance claims
- We will clearly mark experimental features
- We will document limitations and known issues
- We will provide realistic timelines and expectations

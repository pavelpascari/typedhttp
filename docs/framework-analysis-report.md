## 1. Usability & Ergonomics

### 🟢 Strengths

**Intuitive API Design**
```go
// Simple, declarative request definitions
type GetUserRequest struct {
    ID   string `path:"id" validate:"required,uuid"`
    Page int    `query:"page" default:"1" validate:"min=1"`
}

// Clean handler implementation
func (h *UserHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, req GetUserRequest) (GetUserResponse, error) {
    // Business logic only - no HTTP boilerplate
}
```

**Multi-Source Data Extraction**
- Intelligent precedence rules (`header:"X-User-ID" cookie:"user_id" precedence:"header,cookie"`)
- Built-in transformations (`transform:"first_ip"`)
- Seamless validation integration
- Type-safe field access with compile-time guarantees

**Developer Experience Highlights:**
- Zero manual request parsing
- Automatic validation with descriptive errors
- Type-safe responses with proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error handling with structured responses

### 🟡 Areas for Improvement

- Struct tag syntax could be overwhelming for newcomers
- Limited documentation for advanced precedence rules
- Middleware composition could benefit from visual tooling

**Usability Rating: 9/10**

## 2. Boilerplate Requirements & Time to Market

### Minimal Setup Required

**Basic API (Simple Example):** 107 lines total
- Request/Response structs: ~30 lines
- Handler implementation: ~20 lines  
- Router setup: ~15 lines
- Server startup: ~10 lines
- Comprehensive tests: ~32 lines

**Comparison with Native Go HTTP:**
```go
// TypedHTTP (4 lines)
typedhttp.GET(router, "/users/{id}", &UserHandler{},
    typedhttp.WithTags("users"),
    typedhttp.WithSummary("Get user by ID"))

// Native Go (15+ lines)
router.HandleFunc("/users/{id}", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Manual parameter extraction
    id := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
    if id == "" {
        http.Error(w, "ID required", 400)
        return
    }
    // Manual validation
    // Manual JSON marshaling
    // Manual error handling
    // Manual status code setting
})
```
